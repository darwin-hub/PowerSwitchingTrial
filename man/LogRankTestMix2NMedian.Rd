%%  ~~function to do ... ~~

\description{
Find the number of patients required in treatment 1 (control group) to reach a specified power if patients from treatment 1 switches to treatment 2 (experiment group). Requires packages survival and survminer
}
\usage{
LogRankTestMix2NMedian(m1,m2,reps,min,max,proportion,s,alpha,r,a,b,random,upper,lower,power)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{m1}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 1 (control group)
}
  \item{m2}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 2 (experimental group)
}
  \item{reps}{
how many times the test is repeated
}
  \item{Ta,Te}{
Ta is time from the start of the trial until patients stop being recruited
Te is time from the start of the trial until the end of the trial
Time until trial ends, when a patient's survival time would be considered censored if they are still alive, is generated by Te-runif(n, 0, Ta)
}
  \item{proportion}{
Estimated proportion of patients in treatment 1 that will switch to treatment 2
}
  \item{s}{
Switching time (if switching time is fixed), when the patients in treatment 1
(control group) who will switch to treatment 2 will switch to treatment 2 (experimental group)
}
  \item{alpha}{
alpha level/type 1 error
}
  \item{r}{
inital ratio of patients in treatment 2 (experimental group) to treatment 1 (control group)
}
  \item{a,b}{
Switching time (if switching time isn't fixed).
Beta(a,b) is simulated the proportion of total censoring time before the disease progresses
}
  \item{random}{
Logic operator. Either TRUE or FALSE. FALSE means switching time is fixed. TRUE means switching time is generated. (See the example for LogRankTestMix2PowerMedian for arguments when Random is True or False)
}
  \item{lower}{
Lower bound of number of trial patients in treatment 1 tested in binary search
}
  \item{upper}{
upper bound of number of trial patients in treatment 1 tested in binary search
}
  \item{power}{
power that you wish to reach
}
}

\value{
*Scrow down to Examples for more explanations on Values.

Returns N and K. N is the required number of trial patients in treatment 1. K is how many times binary search was preformed before finding N. An K value of 50 means the value of N was not able to be comepletey narrowed down

LogRankTestMix2NMedian(m1=1,m2=1.25,reps=5000,min=999,max=999,proportion=0.6,s=1,alpha=0.05,r=1,random=FALSE,upper=1000,lower=30,power=0.8)

596  11
## In the above, the initial number of trial patients using treatment 1 that is required is 596. The function performed binary search K times

LogRankTestMix2NMedian(m1=1,m2=1.25,reps=5000,min=999,max=999,proportion=0.6,s=1,alpha=0.05,r=1,random=FALSE,upper=500,lower=30,power=0.8)
            [,1]
pwLower   0.0894
pwUpper   0.7338
lower    30.0000
upper   500.0000
## In the above, the range of the lower and upper numbers did not include the power value we specified (0.8) Looking at the results, we can see that they were both smaller than 0.8. If pwLower is greater than the specified power, decrease the lower argument. If pwUpper is smaller than the specified power, increase the upper argument.
