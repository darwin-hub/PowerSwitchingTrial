\title{LogRankTestPowerMedian
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Find the power of a Log Rank Test (Requires Packages survival and survminer)
}
\usage{
LogRankTestPowerMedian(m1,m2,n,min,max,reps,alpha,r)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{m1}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 1
}
  \item{m2}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 2
}
  \item{n}{
Number of patients in treament 1
}
  \item{Ta,Te}{
Ta is time from the start of the trial until patients stop being recruited
Te is time from the start of the trial until the end of the trial
Time until trial ends, when a patient's survival time would be considered censored if they are still alive, is generated by Te-runif(n, 0, Ta)
}
  \item{reps}{
how many times the test is repeated
}
  \item{alpha}{
alpha level/type I error
}
  \item{r}{
ratio of patients in trial two to patients in trial one
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
output number is the power of the test
}

  \note{
r*n must be a whole number,
reps recommended to be atleast 5000 to reduce variation
