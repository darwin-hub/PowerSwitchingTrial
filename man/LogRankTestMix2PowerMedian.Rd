%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Find the power of a Log Rank Test when a proportion of patients of the control group (treatment 1) switches to the experimental group (treatment 2). (Requirese packages survival and survminer)
}
\usage{
LogRankTestMix2PowerMedian(m1,m2,n,reps,Ta,Te,proportion,s,alpha,r,a,b,random)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{m1}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 1 (control group)
}
  \item{m2}{
Estimated median survival time of treatment 2 (experimental group)
}
  \item{n}{
Number of patients in treament 1
}
  \item{reps}{
how many times the test is repeated
}
  \item{Ta,Te}{
Ta is time from the start of the trial until patients stop being recruited
Te is time from the start of the trial until the end of the trial
Time until trial ends, when a patient's survival time would be considered censored if they are still alive, is generated by Te-runif(n, 0, Ta)
}
  \item{proportion}{
Probability of patients in treatment 1 that will switch to treatment 2
}
  \item{s.dist}{
Switching time: one of the five options: “beta”, “gamma”, “unif”, “indepExp”, or a constant value 
}
  \item{alpha}{
alpha level/type 1 error
}
  \item{r}{
The allocation ratio of patients in treatment 2 (experimental group) to treatment 1 (control group)
}
  \item{censor.rate}{
Censor rate
}
  \item{pt}{
pt denotes the ratio of the average switching time to the average event time of the control group.
}
  \item{rho}{
Correlation between switching time and event time.
}

r*n must be a whole number,
reps recommended to be atleast 5000 to reduce variation
